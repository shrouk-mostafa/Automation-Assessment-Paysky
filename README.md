## Brief Explanation of Approach and Tools Used
### Approach
This project employs a data-driven testing approach combined with the Page Object Model (POM) to build a structured, maintainable, and scalable test automation framework. By using Cucumber for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), each step of the checkout and user creation processes is clearly defined in feature files, providing readability and direct alignment with business requirements.

The test data, such as product details and user information, is stored in a JSON file, allowing for flexible data-driven testing. The JsonDataReader utility reads from this JSON file to supply dynamic values to each test step based on the data set index. This allows us to handle multiple test scenarios without modifying code, simplifying updates and increasing test coverage.

JUnit assertions are used to verify outcomes, while Allure Reporting enhances test transparency by tracking execution results and generating detailed reports, which offer insights into test performance and failures.

### Tools Used
#### Selenium: Automates browser-based interactions on the web application.
#### Cucumber: Defines tests in a BDD format using Gherkin syntax, promoting readability and ensuring alignment with business expectations.
#### Page Object Model (POM): A design pattern that separates code into locator and action classes, enhancing modularity, maintainability, and scalability.
#### JSON for Test Data: Supports data-driven testing by enabling test data to be stored externally and updated independently of the test scripts.
#### Jackson Library: Parses JSON data for smooth integration with the data-driven approach.
#### TestNG: Provides structured assertions for validating expected outcomes.
#### Cucumber Reporting: Creates organized test reports with logs, making it easier to track results, troubleshoot failures, and improve test visibility.
#### Rest Assured: Used for API testing, specifically to automate user creation in the ReqRes API, allowing for easy verification of API responses and data validation in the response body.
This approach creates a robust and flexible automation framework that supports easy updates, scales effectively with added test cases, and ensures quality and clarity in testing, from UI-based workflows to API interactions.
